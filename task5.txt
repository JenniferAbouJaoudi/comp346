Block synchronization vs Method Synchronization

Block synchronization is more efficient because it allows one to focus specifically
on one part of the the code (critical section), which allows better throughput.
While in method synchronization, it looks the current instantiated object for the
entire duration of the method. When really all we need is only part of the code
to be synchronized. In the end, block level is more efficient, by potentially producing
more throughput from a given section of the code.
